# containerizing-multi-tier-java-application
This project demonstrates the containerization of a multi-tier Java web application by creating Docker images for each microservice, i.e., load balancer (Nginx), application server, database (MariaDB), cashing engine (Memcached), and massage queue (RabbitMQ), then deploy them as containers.
